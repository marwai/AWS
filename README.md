# AWS 

## Overview 
- API recap
    - Why use API
- Provisioning Machine
- Nodejs
    - What is it?
    - Why use is?

## HTTP Requests and API calls  
Principal or APIs is HTTP requests 

API is a post request, instead of human consumption it is for pc response - essentially interface for computers to computers.

## Webhook
- Reverse APIs' gives applications real-time information
- Unlike APIs where you need to poll (sampling the status of an external device, the continuous checking of other programs 
to see what state they are in) for data very frequently to get it real-time.
- Webhooks are user-defined HTTP callbacks, meaning if you want to know what is happening in a web service or application,
 you can give it a URL to let you know when that happens

## API recap 
- ```Application Programming Interface``` allows two systems to communicate with one another
- An API provides the language for two systems to interact
- Code to govern access points for the server

APIs use HTTP requests to get information from a web application or web server.


## Provision Machine
Provisioners in Vagrant allow you to automatically install software, alter configurations, and more on the machine as 
part of the vagrant up process.
- Provisioning folders
- Installing packages/sw 
- Making configurations (like symlinks and writing to config files)
- Environment variables 

## NodesJs - TODO 

Security Group - API, SSH and Networking 

## Networking 

## Entering our instance 

1) Enter Downloads folder
    cd 
    cd downloads 
    
2) Once You're there move the file into the .ssh folder where the keys are stored
